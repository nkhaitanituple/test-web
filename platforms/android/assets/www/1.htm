    transmitsvery well from 0.6 microns in the visible&nbsp; to 15 microns in the infrared.
    Due to its low absoptivity at several laser wavelengths ZnSe is a excellent in many laser
    system for lenses, windows, output couplers and Beam splitters. Because of its broad
    transmission range and specifically its low absorption and scatter in 8-14 microns
    region,ZnSe is a standard material for use in FLIR and other infrared instruments or
    imaging systems .ZnSe is non-hygroscopic,chemically stable unless treated with strong
    acids, and safe to use in inustrial applications as well as in industrial and field
    applications as well as in labrotary environments.</font><p>&nbsp;</td>

    alternative to ZnSe in medium and high power CW CO<sub>2 </sub>laser systemsfor lenses and
    beam splitters. It is particularly useful in applications where toughness and durability
    are important. Its harness and strength make it a goo choice where dust or abrasive
    particles from the workpiece tend to buil up on,or bombard an optiacl surface. Often in
    cases where frequent cleaning by wiping is require , use of GaAs will extend optic
    lifetime. The material is non hygroscopic , safe to use in labs and field applications and
    it is chemically stable except when contacted with strong acids. </font></td>
